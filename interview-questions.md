# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props in React pass from parent to child classes and back upriver (child to parent) in between components. 

  Researched answer: Props pass information (data and methods) from one component to another in only one direction, from the parent to the child. Props takes certain information from state, and the props either display information or let the user interact with it. Props allows the application to be dynamic versus hardcoding information.


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is when there's code being passed in state and props but nothing is rendered yet. 

  Researched answer: A DOM event is either HTML or React perfoming action based on user input. For example, onclick (HTML) & onClick (React) are DOM events. When the user clicks on a button, then a specified action will happen such as translating a word or words to pig latin.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming or OOP, is when every variable is treated as an object. Methods are able to run on objects.Objects are the intersection of data and behavior so treating every input as an object will return results more efficiently. 

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) was created to help the developer manage and maintain large programs without causing other parts of the software to experience negative side effects. Creating containers for sections of code allows the developers to have many small parts interact seperately versus the entire program being affected with one small change to a certain piece of code. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is that an integer can have one decimal space and still be considered an integer. A float will have more than one decimal space. 

  Researched answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is that a Float needs to be passed in the equation in order to get a Float. An integer will not return any floats when used in an equation. For example, 5 / 3 will result in 1 when putting this equation in Ruby. If the equation is rewritten as 5.0/3.0 the result is 1.6666666666666667.


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return is the last line in the code will be automatically returned without needing an invocation. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return is the value of the last line code will be automatically returned without needing an invocation.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: It is specific to the class it is in and can only be accessed by the set and get method.

2. PostgreSQL: The language that is used to naviagte OOP databases.

3. Ruby on Rails: Creating an application utilizing ruby on rails framework that includes the bones for a database, web service and web pages. 

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping - A technique used to have object oriented programming languages talk to one another and perform in a single database.

5. Active Record: The "in-between" that talks with the Rails application and the database.
